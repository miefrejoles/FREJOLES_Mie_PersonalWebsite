        <p class = "body-param">I am interested in computer networking and hybrid development but, for now I am practicing and developing my skills to be good IT personnel someday. Development for me is the way where you can help other people in terms in guiding them and to create something that will ease and solve their problems by applying the technology present nowadays. When I was a kid I am greatly influenced by everything others opinions and reality, but now I am dealing with own self decisions every day. Being Independent to others is what I have learn this pass few years, if others will fail your expectations it&rsquo;s okay as long as you have done your part and exceed from yourself expectations and learn from the everyday lesson of life. I usually chatting with my family about the current political events, it is great to know what are their opinions and the reason why they made up with that position arguing with their stands is sometimes turned into a massive fun film thing.</p>

        <p span class = "body-param">Creativity is important not only in our daily basis, but also in the industry where someday I would likely to be working with. I am a moderate person with moderate creativity given. The most I can say prostrating time is creating a portray of a person with the use of Photoshop. I hopefully be more creative someday with the proper guidance. </p>
